            The annual ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC’23) brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing. ACM SoCC’23 is the 14th edition of the premier conference on cloud computing; it is the only conference co-sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Groups on Management of Data (<a href="https://sigmod.org/">SIGMOD</a>) and Operating Systems (<a href="https://www.sigops.org/">SIGOPS</a>).</p>



            <p>SoCC’23 will take place in-person in Santa Cruz, California. As in prior SoCC conferences, SoCC’23 will foster connections between the academic and industrial communities operating in the cloud space. </p>

            <p> We solicit original contributions on all aspects of cloud computing. We particularly encourage submissions on the research, development, practice, and experience of cloud computing systems and data management. Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to the following, when related to the cloud:

            <a id="submission"><h2>Submission Categories</h2></a>
            <p>Authors can submit a paper in one of the following categories:</p>
                <ul class="topics-list">
                    <li><b style="color:black">Research Papers (12 pages + unlimited references)</b>: describe original research, where 
                      novelty is a primary consideration.</li>
                    <li><b style="color:black">Industry Papers (12 pages + unlimited references)</b>: 
                    Industry papers describe important industrial advances and application achievements. It encourages work on applying recent research work to real-world problems and industrial systems. Moreover, new applications, systems, challenging real-world use cases, practical customer case studies, as well as analysis of applied technology in an industrial context are highly welcome. We require that at least one of the authors has a non-academic affiliation.
                    </li>
                    <li><b style="color:black">Vision Papers (6 pages + unlimited references)</b>: 
                    Vision papers describe speculative but well-reasoned and thought-provoking ideas, where insight is a primary consideration. Vision papers should present ideas and solutions that differ from prior work and the status quo. A full-fledged system implementation is not required, but empirical evidence and measurements may be helpful in illustrating the feasibility of the proposed vision.
                    </li>
                    <li><b style="color:black">Work-in-Progress Papers (4 pages + unlimited references)</b>: 
                    This is a new category of papers which discusses early-stage results of highly promising research. These papers are similar to workshop papers in other venues, i.e., if you have some early working system and some empirical evidence to support your view, but still have open questions, a work-in-progress paper is a suitable fit. 
                    </li>
                </ul> <br>
            <p>
                All submissions will be judged based on their originality, technical merit, relevance, value to the community, and likelihood of producing interesting discussions at the symposium. Submissions will be kept confidential until accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.
            </p>

            <p>
                At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the conference in order to present the paper.
            </p>

            <a id="guidelines"><h2>Submission Guidelines</h2></a>
                <p>Authors must submit original papers that are not being considered for publication in other forums. Submissions cannot be accompanied by nondisclosure, confidentiality, or similar agreements. Further, all submitted papers must cite and clearly differentiate from relevant prior publications, including workshop papers from the same or other authors.</p>

                <p>Papers that violate these requirements will be rejected without reviews. Judicious use of color is permitted, but the paper should print clearly in black and white. Non-rejected papers will be shepherded, and final acceptance will be conditional on the shepherd’s approval.</p>

                <p>Reviewing for <b>Research, Vision and Work-in-Progress papers is dual anonymous (i.e., author identities will be kept confidential from reviewers during the review process, and vice versa)</b>. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review.</p>

                <p>Reviewing for <b>Industry papers is transparent with respect to the company/product, but dual anonymous with respect to the authors</b>. That is, you need not anonymize the company or products/services you are referring to. However, you should not reveal the paper’s author names directly in your submission.</p>


                <p>Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts (e.g., arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media) is permitted. However, your submission must use an anonymized system/project name that is different from any used in such contexts.</p>

                <p>If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, please contact the program co-chairs (contact information is at the end of the page) well in advance of the submission deadline.</p>
            
            <a id="formatting"><h2>Formatting Guidelines</h2></a>
            <p><b>Formatting</b>: Research papers must follow the ACM Proceedings Format, using either the sample-sigconf.tex provided at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a> for LaTeX (version 2e) or Word, respectively. The margins, inter-column spacing, and line spacing in the templates must be kept unchanged. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review. Judicious use of color is permitted, but the paper should print clearly in black and white.</p>

            <p><b>Paper type</b>: As a subtitle, papers should indicate the submission type (e.g., research, industry, vision, work-in-progress).</p>

            <p><b>File type</b>: Each research paper is to be submitted as a single PDF file, formatted for 8.5" x 11" paper and no more than 10 MB in file size. (Larger files will be rejected by the submission site.) Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers, using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their submitted PDF file renders correctly.  </p>

            <a id="inclusion_guidance"><h2>Guidance on Inclusion</h2></a>
            <p>
            ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC) brings a large scientific and technical community together and has a direct impact on many people from different backgrounds from around the world. Hence, we deeply care about D&I and believe that using inclusive language and examples in paper writing can make a difference. Thus, we strongly encourage authors to follow the <a href="https://dbdni.github.io/pages/inclusivewriting" target="_blank"> D&I writing instructions</a> when drafting the paper submissions.


            <!-- Submitters are encouraged to use inclusive language and examples in their papers.  
            This includes using inclusive language in gendered nouns and pronouns (e.g., 
            see <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/gender-inclusive-language/" 
            style="color:red">this article</a> on gender-inclusive language), and inclusive examples 
            when describing people (e.g., see 
            <a href="https://medium.com/@arunis100/inclusive-cs-examples-b5f40e003815" style="color:red">this blog post</a> 
            on inclusive examples). -->
